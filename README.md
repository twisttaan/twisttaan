### Hey, I'm Tristan Camejo ðŸ‘‹

In my free time I make [music](https://album.link/au/i/1540445932) and create **software**.

I use GitHub to store, run ci, share and collaborate code.

### oss side project

My current side project I'm working on is astray. It's a music player I'm working on to solve my problem of synchronising my music library between my phone and computer.
I thought of this while at the gym listening to unreleased juice wrld via youtube and couldn't lock my phone, switch apps briefly to strong to log my sets or find less popular tracks.

* [astray](https://github.com/twisttaan/astray) - open-source music player that astrays from the rest.
