# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tristan, an aspiring software engineer from Sydney. I love programming with [Go](https://github.com/TeamEvie/eviecoin), [TypeScript](https://github.com/Disploy/deploy) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/EvieClient/Client).

### I'm currently working on:

* [Disploy](https://github.com/Disploy/disploy), a Discord library to create HTTP interaction bots with. It supports Node.js, Deno and Cloudflare Workers.
