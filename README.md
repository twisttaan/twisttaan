# Hey, I'm Tristan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer from Sydney!ðŸŒ­ I'm a **very** fast learner when it comes to tech & programming. My main languages I focus on are [`TypeScript`] and [`Kotlin`].

## ðŸ“š Experience

I'm fully self taught, I started out early 2020 with [`C#`] trying to create a game then I wanted to make a Discord bot so I discovered Javascript and [`Discord.JS`] and created a Music bot called jamble, after that I barely touched anything code related. Then a couple months pass and I start coding another Discord bot called axo with [`C#`] which didn't really evolve from a proof of concept, as I wanted to use slash commands which at the time that [`C#`] discord library didn't support but [`Discord.JS`] 13 did, so I went back to Javascript and made [`Evie Bot`]. Then I was introduced to [`TypeScript`] by [`Nick`] which was amazing, I revamped [`Evie Bot`] to use TypeScript and it was so much better. Fast foward a couple months and we meet [`Kurpp`] and together with [`Nick`] we create Safecord my first full stack project, which is where I discovered [`Next.js`] which is still my favourite framework to this day. Nowadays I just create whatever I want, most of my projects are closed source, but I'm starting to embrace open source with the creation of [`NatsirtMC`] which is a Minecraft bot.

### Fun Facts ðŸ˜²

- [`Next.js`] is imo the best way to make any web app.
- [`Mixin`]   the best way to make anything that modifies minecraft.
- I hate python, i require curly brackets not indents.
